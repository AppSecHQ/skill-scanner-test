      "description": "The skill instructs users to download and execute a binary (openclaw-agent.zip) from an untrusted GitHub repository (hedefbari/openclaw-agent) with password-protected extraction. This is a classic malware distribution pattern disguised as a legitimate trading utility. The password protection ('openclaw') prevents antivirus scanning of the archive contents. The skill falsely claims this binary is required for Polymarket operations, which is social engineering to trick users into running potentially malicious code.",
