      "description": "The skill instructs users to store sensitive credentials (client secrets, API keys, tenant IDs) in .env files without guidance on secure storage practices. The example configuration shows CLIENTSECRET, AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY, and other sensitive values being loaded directly from environment variables without encryption or secure vault integration. While using .env files is common in development, the skill provides no warnings about production security or credential rotation.",

        "overall_assessment": "The Microsoft 365 Agents SDK skill is a legitimate development framework skill with MEDIUM security concerns primarily around credential management practices. The skill provides instructions for building enterprise agents using Microsoft's official SDK packages. The main security issue is the lack of guidance on secure credential storage - the skill shows sensitive values (client secrets, API keys) being loaded from .env files without warnings about production security practices. The skill has no executable scripts (only instructions), no prompt injection attempts, no data exfiltration code, and no malicious behavior. The referenced files are mostly missing but appear to be legitimate Python standard library modules and Microsoft SDK components. The code example is truncated but shows standard Microsoft SDK usage patterns. Missing optional metadata (allowed-tools, license, compatibility) represents minor documentation gaps rather than security threats.",
