## Findings

### MEDIUM Severity

#### [MEDIUM] Hardcoded Credentials in Code Examples

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** data_exfiltration
**Rule ID:** LLM_DATA_EXFILTRATION
**Location:** SKILL.md

**Description:** The SKILL.md instructions contain multiple examples showing connection strings, SAS tokens, and storage account URLs as placeholder values. While these are examples, they demonstrate patterns that could lead users to hardcode sensitive credentials directly in code rather than using secure credential management practices. The skill promotes using connection strings and SAS tokens without emphasizing secure storage mechanisms.

### LOW Severity

#### [LOW] Skill does not specify a license

**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** policy_violation
**Rule ID:** MANIFEST_MISSING_LICENSE
**Location:** SKILL.md

**Description:** Skill manifest does not include a 'license' field. Specifying a license helps users understand usage terms.

#### [LOW] Missing Critical Metadata Fields

**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** social_engineering
**Rule ID:** LLM_SOCIAL_ENGINEERING
**Location:** SKILL.md

**Description:** The skill manifest is missing several important metadata fields including 'license', 'compatibility', and 'allowed-tools'. While 'allowed-tools' is optional, its absence means there are no declared restrictions on what agent tools this skill can use. The missing compatibility field doesn't inform users about environment requirements (Java runtime, Azure connectivity, etc.).

#### [LOW] Incomplete Documentation - Referenced Files Missing

**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** social_engineering
**Rule ID:** LLM_SOCIAL_ENGINEERING

**Description:** The skill references three files (Stream.py, URL.py, File.py) in the instructions but these files are not found in the skill package. This creates misleading documentation as users may expect these Python examples to exist. The references appear to be artifacts from incomplete documentation or incorrect file extensions (should be .java not .py for a Java SDK skill).

#### [LOW] Unpinned Dependency Version in Installation Instructions

**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** data_exfiltration
**Rule ID:** LLM_DATA_EXFILTRATION
**Location:** SKILL.md

**Description:** While the Maven dependency example shows a specific version (12.33.0), the skill doesn't emphasize the importance of version pinning or warn about supply chain security. Users might modify this to use version ranges or latest versions, introducing potential supply chain risks.
