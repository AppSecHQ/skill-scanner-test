      "description": "The skill's explicit purpose is to 'bypass detection' and make AI-generated content 'undetectable' by academic integrity tools like Turnitin, GPTZero, and Originality.ai. The description states it 'rewrites ChatGPT, Claude, and GPT content to sound natural and pass AI detectors.' This is designed to facilitate academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and circumvention of content authenticity verification systems. The skill actively promotes deceptive practices by helping users submit AI-generated work as their own.",

The primary threat is not technical security (no data exfiltration, command injection, or credential theft detected), but rather the skill's intended purpose of enabling deceptive practices. The code itself appears to be straightforward text transformation using pattern matching and replacements from a JSON configuration file. However, the skill's explicit marketing as a detector evasion tool for academic integrity systems like Turnitin represents harmful and misleading content (AITech-15.1). The framing as an educational tool based on Wikipedia research is deceptive social engineering (AITech-2.1). Organizations should consider blocking this skill due to its facilitation of academic dishonesty, regardless of its technical implementation.",
