      "description": "The template scripts (form-automation.sh, authenticated-session.sh) contain examples with hardcoded credentials like 'SecureP@ssw0rd!' and 'password123'. While these are template examples meant to be replaced, they demonstrate insecure practices and could be copied by users without modification, leading to credential exposure in scripts.",

The skill itself does not contain malicious code or data exfiltration attempts. The main risks are: 1) Template scripts demonstrate insecure credential practices that users might copy, 2) Session state files containing authentication data are saved without encryption or access controls, 3) Documentation lacks sufficient security warnings about sensitive data handling. The skill operates as described and does not exhibit deceptive behavior, prompt injection, or tool exploitation. The referenced files are internal to the skill package (templates and references directories), which is normal and expected behavior.
