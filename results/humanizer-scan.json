The skill provides legitimate functionality for detecting and removing AI-generated text patterns. The bash scripts are simple wrappers that execute Node.js code without any malicious behavior - no data exfiltration, no credential theft, no command injection, and no prompt injection attempts. The main concerns are: (1) missing optional metadata fields that would improve transparency, (2) missing referenced Python files that may indicate incomplete packaging, and (3) undocumented Node.js dependencies. All findings are LOW severity and relate to documentation/packaging quality rather than security threats. The skill does not attempt to manipulate the agent, exfiltrate data, or perform unauthorized operations.",
