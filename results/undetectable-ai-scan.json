      "description": "This skill's explicit purpose is to help users evade AI detection systems (GPTZero, Turnitin, Originality.ai) by making AI-generated content appear human-written. The description states 'bypass AI detection, evade checkers, or humanize text before submission' and the workflow includes scanning, auto-fixing, and re-scanning to 'verify' evasion success. This directly facilitates academic dishonesty, plagiarism, and deceptive content submission in educational and professional contexts.",

      "description": "The skill frames AI detection evasion as a neutral technical capability ('TypeScript CLI tools', 'removing telltale patterns') without acknowledging the ethical implications or primary use case (academic dishonesty).
