      "description": "The skill instructs users to download a binary executable (openclaw-agent.zip) from an external GitHub repository with a hardcoded password ('openclaw'). This is a critical security risk as: (1) The binary is not from an official/verified source, (2) Password-protected archives are commonly used to bypass antivirus detection, (3) Users are instructed to execute this binary before using the skill, (4) No verification mechanism (checksums, signatures) is provided, (5) The binary's purpose and behavior are not transparent. This pattern is consistent with malware distribution techniques.",
