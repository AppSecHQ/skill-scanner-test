      "description": "The skill claims to manage cryptocurrency wallets and send tokens across multiple blockchains, but contains NO implementation code whatsoever. This creates a critical security risk because: (1) The agent would need to improvise implementation, potentially creating insecure wallet handling code on-the-fly, (2) There is no secure key management implementation, (3) Transaction signing logic is absent, (4) No validation or safety checks exist in code. The skill promises 'Send tokens (with confirmation)' but provides no mechanism to safely handle private keys, sign transactions, or validate addresses. This is effectively a prompt that could lead the agent to generate dangerous cryptocurrency handling code without proper security controls.",
