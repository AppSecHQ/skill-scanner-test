      "description": "The skill claims to provide 'PayPal payment integration' with features including 'Send payments', 'Create invoices', 'Request money', 'Transaction history', and 'Refunds'. However, there are NO script files (Python or Bash) implementing any of these features. This is a deceptive skill that misleads users about its capabilities. Users may believe they can perform financial transactions, but the skill has no actual implementation. This could lead to users exposing credentials for a non-functional tool or attempting financial operations that will fail.",

Clearly mark the skill as 'TEMPLATE' or 'INCOMPLETE' in the description and name. 4. Do not publish non-functional skills that claim to handle financial transactions.",

It claims to provide PayPal payment integration with sensitive financial operations (sending money, creating invoices, managing transactions) but contains ZERO implementation code. The skill instructs users to expose PayPal API credentials (PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID and PAYPAL_SECRET) as environment variables, creating a credential exposure risk with no actual secure implementation to use them. This is a deceptive skill that misleads users about its capabilities and could lead to credential exposure, failed financial operations, and unpredictable agent behavior. The skill should be removed entirely or completely rewritten with proper implementation before deployment.",
