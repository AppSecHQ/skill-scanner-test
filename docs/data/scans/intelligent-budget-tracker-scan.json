      "title": "Misleading Skill Description - TypeScript Library Presented as Agent Skill",
      "description": "The skill presents itself as a TypeScript/npm library ('npm install agent-money-tracker') with TypeScript code examples, but Agent Skills are local directory packages containing SKILL.md with markdown instructions and optional Python/Bash scripts. This is a fundamental mismatch between the claimed format (TypeScript library) and the actual Agent Skill format. The instructions contain no actionable guidance for an agent - only npm installation commands and TypeScript API documentation that cannot be executed in the Agent Skill context.",
      "file_path": null,
      "line_number": null,
      "snippet": "Installation section shows 'npm install agent-money-tracker' and all code examples use TypeScript syntax like 'import { clawhub } from 'agent-money-tracker'' and 'await clawhub.initialize()' which are not compatible with Agent Skill execution model.",
      "remediation": "Rewrite SKILL.md to provide actual agent instructions in markdown format (e.g., 'When the user asks to track an expense, use the Python tool to...'). If this is meant to be a library wrapper, include actual Python/Bash scripts that the agent can execute, and provide clear instructions on how the agent should use those scripts.",

The skill presents itself as a TypeScript npm library rather than a proper Agent Skill package, making it non-functional in the agent context. The missing 'natural.py' file creates a potential security vector for tool poisoning attacks. While no active malicious code was detected (no scripts are present), the fundamental mismatch between claimed functionality and actual deliverable format, combined with missing dependencies, makes this skill unreliable and potentially exploitable. The skill requires significant restructuring to function as an actual Agent Skill with proper Python/Bash scripts and agent-executable instructions.",
