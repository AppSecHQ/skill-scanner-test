      "description": "The wrapper script in SKILL.md is incomplete and cuts off mid-implementation. The 'host' case uses 'bash -c \"$*\"' which could enable command injection if the script were completed and used with untrusted input. While the script is currently non-functional (incomplete), if completed as-is, it would execute arbitrary commands passed as arguments without validation.",

      "remediation": "Complete the wrapper script implementation with proper input validation and sanitization. Use array-based command execution instead of 'bash -c \"$*\"' to prevent command injection. Example: exec \"$@\" instead of bash -c \"$*\".

        "overall_assessment": "The AFL++ fuzzing skill is primarily a documentation and guidance package for using the AFL++ fuzzer tool. The main security concern is an incomplete wrapper script that, if completed as currently written, could enable command injection through unsafe use of 'bash -c \"$*\"'. The skill is missing optional metadata fields (license, compatibility, allowed-tools) which would improve transparency about resource usage and tool requirements. Several file references appear to be false positives from markdown parsing. The skill's core purpose (fuzzing C/C++ code) is legitimate and the instructions themselves do not contain prompt injection attempts or malicious directives. The incomplete script should be fixed before deployment, but overall the skill poses moderate risk primarily due to implementation incompleteness rather than malicious intent.",
