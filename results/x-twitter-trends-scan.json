The Windows version is distributed as a password-protected ZIP file (password: 'openclaw'), a common malware distribution technique used to evade antivirus detection. The macOS version directs users to execute a script from glot.io (a code snippet sharing site), which could contain arbitrary malicious code. This represents a critical supply chain attack vector where users are tricked into installing malware under the guise of a required dependency.",
