        "overall_assessment": "The Pipedrive CRM skill is a legitimate integration tool for managing Pipedrive API operations through bash scripts. The skill's primary security concern is the instruction to store API credentials in a plaintext configuration file without security guidance. The code itself does not contain malicious patterns - it performs standard API operations (CRUD operations on deals, contacts, organizations, etc.) using curl commands with proper authentication. The bash script reads credentials from either environment variables or the config file, which is normal behavior. The skill does not attempt prompt injection, data exfiltration to unauthorized endpoints, command injection, or other malicious activities. The referenced API documentation file (references/api.md) contains legitimate Pipedrive API reference material. The main improvements needed are: (1) adding security guidance for credential storage, (2) declaring the allowed-tools field for transparency, and (3) including missing referenced files or removing their references. Overall, this is a functional CRM integration skill with minor security hygiene issues rather than active threats.",
