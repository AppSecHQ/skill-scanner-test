      "description": "The skill instructs the agent to download and execute a shell script directly from GitHub using 'curl | bash' without any cryptographic verification (no checksums, signatures, or hashes). This creates a critical supply chain attack vector where a compromised GitHub account, man-in-the-middle attack, or repository takeover could result in arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. The 'Quick install' method provides no security guarantees about the script's integrity.",

Mining is configured to run indefinitely in daemon mode with 'nice -n 19' priority adjustment but no CPU caps, time limits, or user confirmation for extended operation. The instruction 'scale up once you confirm everything is stable' encourages increasing resource consumption. This can lead to sustained CPU exhaustion, thermal issues, increased power consumption, and degraded system performance for other tasks.",
