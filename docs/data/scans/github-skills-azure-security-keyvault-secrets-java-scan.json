      "title": "Hardcoded Secrets in Code Examples",
      "description": "The instruction body contains hardcoded sensitive credentials in code examples, including a database password ('P@ssw0rd123!') and an API key ('sk_live_abc123xyz'). While these appear to be example values for demonstration purposes, including literal secrets in documentation creates security risks: users may copy-paste these examples without changing credentials, developers may accidentally commit real secrets following this pattern, and it normalizes hardcoding secrets in code. Best practice is to use placeholder values like '<your-password-here>' or environment variable references.",

      "remediation": "Replace all hardcoded credential values with placeholders (e.g., '<your-database-password>', '<your-api-key>') or references to environment variables. Add explicit warnings in documentation that example credentials must never be used in production. Consider using clearly fake formats like 'example_password_replace_me' to make it obvious these are not real credentials.",

        "overall_assessment": "This Azure Key Vault Secrets Java SDK skill is primarily a documentation/reference package with MEDIUM security concerns. The main issue is hardcoded example credentials in code samples (database password and API key), which could lead to credential exposure if users copy-paste without modification. The skill has no executable scripts, reducing attack surface significantly. Missing optional metadata (license, compatibility, allowed-tools) and a referenced but missing backup.py file are minor documentation issues. The incomplete code example could cause runtime problems. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate Azure SDK documentation skill with documentation quality issues rather than malicious intent, but the hardcoded credentials pattern should be addressed to prevent accidental credential exposure.",
