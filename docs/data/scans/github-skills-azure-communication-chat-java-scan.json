      "description": "The instruction body contains placeholder patterns for sensitive credentials including user access tokens and user IDs that could lead to accidental credential exposure if users copy-paste examples without proper sanitization. The examples show '<user-access-token>' and '<user-id-1>' patterns which may encourage developers to hardcode credentials directly in source code rather than using secure credential management practices.",

        "overall_assessment": "This Azure Communication Chat Java SDK skill is primarily a DOCUMENTATION AND REFERENCE skill with MEDIUM security concerns. The skill provides code examples and API usage patterns for Azure Communication Services but does not contain executable scripts or autonomous behaviors. Primary concerns are: (1) Code examples that could encourage credential hardcoding practices (MEDIUM severity), (2) Missing metadata fields that reduce transparency (LOW severity), (3) A missing referenced file that creates package incompleteness (LOW severity), and (4) An incomplete code example that could mislead users (LOW severity). The skill does not exhibit malicious behavior, data exfiltration, prompt injection, or tool exploitation. It functions as intended - providing Java SDK documentation and examples. However, the credential handling patterns in examples could lead to security issues in downstream implementations if users copy-paste without understanding secure practices.",
