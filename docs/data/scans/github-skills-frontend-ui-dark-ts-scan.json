      "title": "Unpinned Package Versions in Dependencies",
      "description": "The skill documentation specifies package versions using caret (^) ranges (e.g., 'react: ^18.x', 'framer-motion: ^11.x') rather than exact versions. This creates supply chain risk as future minor/patch versions could introduce breaking changes, vulnerabilities, or unexpected behavior when the skill is used.",

      "remediation": "Pin exact package versions in the documentation (e.g., 'react: 18.2.0' instead of '^18.x') to ensure reproducible builds and prevent unexpected updates. Use package-lock.json or yarn.lock to lock transitive dependencies.",

        "overall_assessment": "This skill is a frontend development template for building dark-themed React applications. It appears to be primarily documentation-focused, providing code examples, design tokens, and component patterns. No critical security threats were identified. The skill contains no executable scripts (Python/Bash), no network calls, no data exfiltration attempts, no prompt injection, and no malicious code. The main concerns are supply chain related: unpinned package versions create moderate risk of dependency confusion or unexpected updates, and missing metadata (license, compatibility, allowed-tools) reduces transparency. Several referenced files are missing from the package, which could cause user confusion but does not pose a security threat. Overall, this skill is safe to use but would benefit from better dependency management and complete file inclusion.",

While caret ranges are common in JavaScript development, they do introduce risk of unexpected updates. However, this is a documentation skill providing templates, not executable code that will auto-install packages, so the actual risk is lower than if this were an automated installer script.",
        "meta_exploitability": "Low - Requires user to manually install packages using the documented versions. The skill itself doesn't execute npm install.",
        "meta_impact": "Medium - Could lead to broken builds or unexpected behavior if future package versions introduce breaking changes, but no direct security exploit."
