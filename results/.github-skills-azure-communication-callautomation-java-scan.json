        "overall_assessment": "This Azure Communication Services Call Automation skill is primarily a documentation/tutorial skill providing Java SDK examples. It contains no executable scripts and poses minimal direct security risk. The main concerns are: (1) missing metadata fields (license, compatibility, allowed-tools) which are informational/low severity issues, (2) code examples that demonstrate credential handling patterns without sufficient security warnings, and (3) a missing referenced file. The skill does not contain prompt injection attempts, data exfiltration code, command injection, or other high-severity threats. The credential handling examples warrant a MEDIUM severity finding as they could lead users to hardcode secrets if not properly warned. Overall, this is a relatively safe documentation skill that would benefit from improved metadata and security guidance in the examples.",
