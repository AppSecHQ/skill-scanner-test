While the skill itself doesn't contain hardcoded secrets, it creates a dependency on an external commercial API service that requires user registration and credential management. The instructions guide users to store the API key in shell configuration files (~/.zshenv), which could be exposed if the user's environment is compromised. Additionally, all API calls transmit this credential to an external service, creating a potential data exposure vector if the external service is compromised or malicious.",
