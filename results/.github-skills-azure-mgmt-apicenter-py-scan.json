      "description": "The skill instructs installation of 'azure-mgmt-apicenter' and 'azure-identity' packages without specifying version pins. This creates a supply chain risk where future malicious or breaking versions could be automatically installed, potentially introducing vulnerabilities or breaking functionality. The installation commands use 'pip install' without version constraints (e.g., ==1.2.3 or ~=1.2).",

        "overall_assessment": "This Azure API Center Management SDK skill is a legitimate documentation/tutorial package for Azure API management operations. The skill contains NO malicious code, data exfiltration attempts, prompt injection, or credential theft. It is primarily instructional content showing how to use the official Azure SDK. The security findings are limited to supply chain hygiene (unpinned dependencies), documentation completeness (missing manifest fields, incomplete code example), and operational guidance (environment variable validation). These are LOW to MEDIUM severity issues related to best practices rather than active threats. The skill is SAFE for use but would benefit from improved dependency management and documentation completeness.",
