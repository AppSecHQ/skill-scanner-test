The primary concerns are: (1) hardcoded credential paths creating exposure risk, (2) complete dependency on an unverified external trading tool (bankr) enabling tool poisoning, (3) command injection vulnerabilities in parameter handling, (4) lack of enforcement for stated safety limits allowing unbounded automated trading, and (5) deceptive framing of high-risk gambling as systematic trading. The skill handles financial transactions and credentials but lacks fundamental security controls like input validation, credential protection, and circuit breakers. The automated trading features could lead to significant financial loss if exploited or if the external bankr tool is compromised. The 'launch sniping' functionality promotes extremely high-risk behavior (80% expected loss rate) with inadequate warnings. Immediate remediation is required before this skill should be used in any production environment.",
