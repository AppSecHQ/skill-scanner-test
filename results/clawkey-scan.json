While HTTPS is used, there's no mention of certificate pinning or validation requirements for this identity/verification service.",

The skill's core purpose (verifiable human ownership via palm verification) is legitimate, but the implementation guidance has several gaps. Primary concerns: (1) Hardcoded API endpoint without TLS verification guidance, (2) Private key handling instructions lack technical safeguards, (3) Missing referenced implementation files make full security review impossible, (4) Incomplete error handling documentation. The skill does NOT contain active malicious code (no data exfiltration, no prompt injection, no command injection), but the incomplete implementation and missing safeguards create risk of accidental key exposure or insecure API interactions. The skill would benefit from: complete code examples with proper key handling, TLS certificate validation requirements, comprehensive error handling, and inclusion of all referenced files.",
