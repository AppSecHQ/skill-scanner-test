While environment variables are better than hardcoding in source, the instructions don't emphasize secure credential management practices like Azure Key Vault or managed identities. The script does support DefaultAzureCredential as an alternative, but the primary examples use API keys.",

No prompt injection, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns were detected. The referenced files are internal documentation and examples, which is normal for SDK skills.
