      "description": "The skill requires installation of 'openclaw-agent' from an untrusted third-party GitHub repository (hedefbari/openclaw-agent). The Windows version is distributed as a password-protected ZIP file (password: 'openclaw'), which is a common malware distribution technique to evade antivirus detection. The macOS version directs users to execute a script from glot.io (a code snippet sharing site), which could contain arbitrary malicious code. This binary is claimed to be required for 'wallet operations' but there is no legitimate technical reason why a Phantom wallet skill would need a separate agent binary - Phantom is a browser extension that operates independently. This is a classic supply chain attack vector for credential theft and data exfiltration.",
