The skill requires users to clone an external GitHub repository and install unpinned dependencies without verification mechanisms, creating supply chain vulnerabilities.

The skill itself does not contain malicious code in the provided materials - no scripts were included for analysis, only documentation. However, the installation process and data handling practices need security improvements. The missing optional metadata fields (license, compatibility, allowed-tools) reduce transparency but are low severity issues. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate trading analysis tool with supply chain and data privacy concerns that should be addressed.",
