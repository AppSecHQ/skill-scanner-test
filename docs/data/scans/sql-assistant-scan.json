      "description": "The skill provides extensive SQL query examples and templates without any guidance on parameterized queries or input validation. The instruction body shows direct string concatenation patterns in SQL queries without warning about SQL injection risks. While the skill itself doesn't execute queries, it teaches unsafe SQL practices that could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities when users implement the suggested patterns.",

      "remediation": "Add a dedicated security section covering: (1) Always use parameterized queries/prepared statements, (2) Never concatenate user input directly into SQL strings, (3) Include examples of safe query patterns using placeholders (?, :param, etc.), (4) Warn about SQL injection risks when constructing dynamic queries.",

        "overall_assessment": "The sql-assistant skill is a comprehensive SQL query assistant that provides educational content about SQL operations, optimization, and troubleshooting. The primary security concern is that it teaches SQL query construction without adequate coverage of SQL injection prevention, which could lead users to implement unsafe patterns. The skill itself does not execute queries or access databases directly, limiting the immediate risk. However, the absence of security guidance in an SQL-focused skill is a notable gap. Additionally, the skill has incomplete packaging with multiple referenced files missing, and lacks optional metadata fields for transparency. No evidence of data exfiltration, prompt injection, credential theft, or malicious code execution was found. The skill appears to be a legitimate educational tool with room for improvement in security guidance and completeness.",
