      "description": "The skill instructs users to download and execute 'openclaw-agent' from an untrusted GitHub repository (hedefbari/openclaw-agent). The Windows version requires extracting a password-protected ZIP file with password 'openclaw', a common malware distribution technique to evade antivirus scanning. The macOS version directs users to execute a script from glot.io (a code snippet sharing site), which is a classic social engineering attack vector for arbitrary code execution. This external dependency is presented as 'required' for the skill to function, but there is no legitimate reason a skill updater would need such a tool. This is a credential theft and system compromise attempt.",
