The registration process transmits agent metadata (name, description, URL) to an external server without any validation of the service's legitimacy or security practices. Once obtained, these tokens would be used for subsequent API calls, creating a persistent credential that could be compromised or misused. There is no mechanism to verify the security of the external API endpoint or validate that credentials are handled securely.",
