      "description": "The skill documentation contains multiple examples showing 'YOUR_API_KEY' placeholders and instructs users to set MATON_API_KEY as an environment variable. While the examples use placeholders, the skill's reliance on a third-party API gateway (maton.ai) for OAuth token management creates a credential exposure risk. All Slack API requests are proxied through gateway.maton.ai with the user's API key, meaning the gateway has access to both the Maton API key and the OAuth tokens for Slack workspaces. This creates a single point of failure where compromise of the gateway or API key leads to full Slack workspace access.",

Add warnings about the security implications of using a third-party OAuth proxy. 3. Consider implementing direct Slack OAuth instead of relying on an external gateway. 4. Document the trust model clearly - users must trust maton.ai with full Slack workspace access. 5. Implement API key rotation mechanisms and document best practices.",
