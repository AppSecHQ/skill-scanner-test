      "description": "The skill documentation instructs users to export INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN as an environment variable. While this is a common pattern, the documentation does not provide any warnings about token security, rotation policies, or scope limitations. Instagram access tokens can provide broad access to user accounts including posting content, accessing private messages, and viewing analytics. The skill's metadata indicates this token is required (primaryEnv: INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN) but lacks security guidance.",

The skill requires a sensitive Instagram access token with potentially broad permissions but provides no security warnings or best practices. Most critically, the skill claims extensive functionality (posting, analytics, comment management) but contains no actual implementation code, creating a tool exploitation risk where unrestricted bash/curl commands may be used with the access token. The missing metadata fields (license, compatibility, allowed-tools) reduce transparency about the skill's intended behavior and restrictions. While no active malicious code was detected, the combination of sensitive credential requirements, missing implementation, and lack of security guidance creates meaningful risk. The skill requires significant hardening before production use.",
