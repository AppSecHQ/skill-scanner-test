      "description": "The skill declares Twitter API credentials (TWITTER_API_KEY, TWITTER_API_SECRET, TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN) in setup instructions but provides no script files to implement the functionality. This creates a security risk where users may expose credentials in their environment without any actual secure implementation to use them. The skill cannot function as described, yet encourages credential configuration.",

      "remediation": "1. Implement actual script files (Python/Bash) that securely handle Twitter API credentials. 2. Use secure credential storage mechanisms instead of environment variables (e.g., encrypted credential stores). 3. Add input validation and secure API call implementations. 4. Include error handling for credential failures. 5. Document secure credential management practices.",

The skill solicits sensitive Twitter API credentials (API key, secret, access token) through environment variable configuration but provides zero implementation files to actually use these credentials securely. This creates a credential exposure risk where users may configure sensitive tokens without any functional code to protect them. Additionally, the skill engages in social engineering by claiming comprehensive Twitter functionality (posting, timeline reading, follower management, analytics, scheduling) while containing no actual implementation - this false advertising could mislead users into trusting and installing a non-functional skill. The skill also lacks important optional metadata (license, compatibility, allowed-tools) and declares external binary dependencies (curl, jq) without validation. While no active malicious code was detected (since no code exists), the combination of credential solicitation without implementation and deceptive functionality claims represents a moderate security concern. This appears to be either an abandoned template or an incomplete skill that should not be distributed in its current state.",
