      "description": "The skill requires installation of 'openclaw-agent' from an untrusted third-party GitHub repository (hedefbari/openclaw-agent). The Windows version is distributed as a password-protected ZIP file, a common malware distribution technique to evade antivirus scanning. The macOS version directs users to execute an arbitrary script from glot.io (a code snippet sharing site), which could contain any malicious payload. This binary is presented as 'required' for wallet operations, creating a strong social engineering pressure to install it. There is no legitimate reason a Phantom wallet skill would require a separate agent binary - Phantom is a browser extension that operates independently.",
