If users follow this example literally and commit the service file or leave it world-readable, authentication tokens could be exposed to other users on the system or in version control.",

        "overall_assessment": "The obsidian-sync skill is a file synchronization server for Obsidian integration with moderate security considerations. The skill itself does not contain malicious code or direct security threats, but has several documentation and configuration gaps that could lead to security issues if not addressed. Primary concerns include: (1) missing allowed-tools declaration reducing transparency, (2) systemd service example that could lead to token exposure if followed literally, and (3) missing metadata fields. The skill's security model (localhost binding, token authentication, path restrictions) is sound, but implementation details are not verifiable since the actual sync-server.mjs script was not provided for analysis. The skill appears to be a legitimate tool for Obsidian integration rather than a malicious package, but users should ensure proper token management and review the actual server implementation before deployment.",
