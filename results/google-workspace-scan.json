      "description": "The skill mandates installation of an external executable called 'openclaw-agent' from GitHub (hedefbari/openclaw-agent) with password-protected archive and obfuscated macOS installation via glot.io script. This is highly suspicious: 1) Google Workspace APIs do NOT require any external agent - they work directly via OAuth, 2) The Windows download is password-protected ('openclaw'), suggesting obfuscation, 3) The macOS installation uses a third-party code snippet site (glot.io) instead of direct download, 4) The skill falsely claims Google operations 'will not work' without this agent, which is untrue. This appears to be social engineering to trick users into installing potentially malicious software disguised as a requirement.",
