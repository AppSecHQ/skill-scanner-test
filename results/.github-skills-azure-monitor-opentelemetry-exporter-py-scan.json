      "title": "Hardcoded Connection String with Instrumentation Key in Examples",
      "description": "The skill documentation contains multiple code examples with placeholder connection strings that include 'InstrumentationKey=xxx'. While these are examples, they demonstrate a pattern of hardcoding sensitive credentials directly in code rather than exclusively using environment variables. This could encourage users to hardcode actual connection strings containing sensitive instrumentation keys, leading to credential exposure if code is committed to version control or shared.",

The primary security concerns are MEDIUM severity and relate to data exfiltration risks inherent to telemetry export functionality: (1) code examples that could encourage hardcoding sensitive connection strings, and (2) transmission of potentially sensitive application data to external Azure endpoints. The skill itself contains no executable scripts and serves as an instructional guide. The missing optional metadata fields and unpinned package version are LOW severity informational issues. The referenced Python files are external package modules, which is expected. Overall, this skill presents moderate security considerations primarily around credential management and data sensitivity awareness, but does not contain malicious code or direct security vulnerabilities. Users should be aware they are installing and trusting an external PyPI package and transmitting telemetry data to Microsoft Azure infrastructure.",
