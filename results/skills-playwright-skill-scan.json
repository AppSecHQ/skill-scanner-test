        "overall_assessment": "The playwright-skill is a legitimate browser automation tool with MODERATE security concerns. The skill's core functionality (writing Playwright test scripts and executing them via Node.js) is appropriate for its stated purpose. Primary concerns include: (1) missing allowed-tools declaration reducing transparency, (2) dynamic path resolution pattern that requires agent-side variable substitution, and (3) use of shared /tmp directory for executable scripts. No evidence of data exfiltration, credential theft, prompt injection, or malicious behavior was found. The skill appears to be a genuine development tool for browser testing. The referenced files (this.py, skill.py, user.py) were not found, but API_REFERENCE.md contains legitimate Playwright documentation. Recommended for use with the remediation steps applied.",
