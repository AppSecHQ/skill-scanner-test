        "overall_assessment": "The Notion skill provides API integration functionality with managed OAuth through the Maton gateway service. The skill is primarily documentation-based with curl examples and does not contain executable scripts in the package. Key security concerns include: (1) Missing referenced Python file (Notion.py) which could create tool poisoning risks, (2) Lack of explicit security guidance for API key handling despite multiple examples using credentials, and (3) Missing optional metadata fields (allowed-tools, license) that would improve transparency. The skill does not exhibit prompt injection, data exfiltration to unauthorized endpoints, or malicious code patterns. However, the missing Notion.py file and incomplete security guidance around credential management warrant attention before production use.",
