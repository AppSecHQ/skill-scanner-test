      "description": "The skill presents itself as an agent skill package but actually describes an external npm package ('npx ai-landing'). The SKILL.md contains no agent instructions, only documentation for a separate command-line tool. This is deceptive because users expect agent skills to provide instructions the agent follows, not documentation for external tools. The skill cannot function as described since it requires 'npx' execution and OPENAI_API_KEY, which are not part of the agent skill framework.",

      "remediation": "Either: (1) Rewrite as a proper agent skill with instructions for the agent to generate landing pages directly, or (2) Clearly state in the description that this is documentation for an external tool, not a functional agent skill. Add proper agent instructions if intended as a skill.",

While no active malicious behavior is detected (no data exfiltration, command injection, or prompt injection), the misleading presentation and broken dependencies create moderate security and functionality concerns. The skill cannot function as described and may confuse users about its actual capabilities.
