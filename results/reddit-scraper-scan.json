      "description": "The script makes HTTP requests to Reddit's JSON API without implementing rate limiting or retry delays. While the TECHNICAL.md documentation mentions Reddit's rate limits (~60 requests per minute), the code does not enforce delays between requests. This could lead to 403 Forbidden errors or temporary blocks from Reddit if users make rapid successive requests.",

      "remediation": "Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse:\n```python\nimport time\n\nclass RedditScraper:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.last_request_time = 0\n        self.min_request_interval = 1.0  # 1 second between requests\n    \n    def _fetch_json(self, url, params):\n        # Enforce minimum delay between requests\n        elapsed = time.time() - self.last_request_time\n        if elapsed < self.min_request_interval:\n            time.sleep(self.min_request_interval - elapsed)\n        \n        response = self.session.get(url, params=params)\n        self.last_request_time = time.time()\n        return response\n```",

Security analysis reveals NO CRITICAL or HIGH severity threats. The skill does not attempt prompt injection, data exfiltration, credential theft, or malicious code execution. It makes legitimate HTTP requests to Reddit's public API with appropriate User-Agent headers. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, eval/exec usage, or command injection vulnerabilities. Three LOW severity findings were identified: (1) missing optional metadata fields in the manifest, (2) lack of rate limiting implementation that could lead to API throttling, and (3) references to non-existent files in the documentation. The skill operates as described - it provides read-only access to Reddit content without authentication, posting, or commenting capabilities. The implementation is transparent and matches its stated purpose.",
