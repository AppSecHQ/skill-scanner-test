      "description": "The skill instructs users to store sensitive credentials (DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY) in environment variables without providing guidance on secure storage mechanisms. While environment variables are mentioned, there is no warning about the risks of exposing API keys or recommendations for using secure credential management systems (e.g., Azure Key Vault, .NET Secret Manager). This could lead users to hardcode credentials in configuration files or expose them in version control systems.",

The skill instructs users to store sensitive API keys and SAS tokens in environment variables without adequate security guidance, which could lead to credential exposure if users follow the examples in insecure environments. The skill also contains a misleading reference to a non-existent Python file and lacks optional metadata fields. Overall, the skill is relatively safe as it contains no executable code, but the credential handling guidance needs improvement to prevent users from inadvertently exposing sensitive credentials.",
