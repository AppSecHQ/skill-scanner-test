      "title": "Unbounded Autonomous Cron Job Without User Consent",
      "description": "The skill requires setting up a cron job 'openpet-tick' that runs every 2 hours to decay pet stats and send alerts. This creates an autonomous background process that operates without explicit user confirmation for each execution. The cron job modifies pet state, checks death conditions, and sends platform alerts automatically, which could lead to unexpected resource usage and notification spam if users are not actively managing their pets.",

      "snippet": "Set up cron job `openpet-tick` every 2 hours:\n- hunger +15, happiness -10, energy -5\n- Clamp all stats 0-100\n- Check death conditions\n- Alert owner if critical (hunger >80 or happiness <20)\n- Increment age daily",
      "remediation": "1. Add explicit user opt-in for cron job activation during pet creation\n2. Implement rate limiting on alerts to prevent notification spam\n3. Add user controls to pause/resume the cron job\n4. Document the autonomous behavior clearly in the skill description\n5. Consider requiring periodic user confirmation to keep the cron job active",

The skill implements an unbounded cron job that runs every 2 hours without explicit user consent, potentially leading to resource consumption and notification spam. The cross-platform alert system lacks rate limiting, which could result in excessive notifications. Several referenced files are missing from the package (message.py, unknown.py, templates/sprites.json), indicating incomplete implementation that may cause runtime errors. The skill does not exhibit critical threats like data exfiltration, credential theft, or prompt injection. However, the autonomous cron job and alert system require better user controls and rate limiting. The missing optional metadata fields (license, compatibility, allowed-tools) reduce transparency but are low severity issues. Overall, this skill needs improvements to autonomous behavior controls and package completeness before production use.",

      "description": "The skill sends alerts to users across multiple platforms (Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal) when pet conditions are critical. There is no rate limiting, cooldown period, or user preference system for these alerts. This could result in alert spam if multiple pets reach critical states simultaneously, or if the cron job triggers repeatedly while conditions remain critical.
