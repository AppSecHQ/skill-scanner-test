While this field is optional per the agent skills spec, its absence means users cannot verify which agent capabilities (Read, Write, Bash, Python, etc.) the skill intends to use.

        "overall_assessment": "The youtube-transcript skill is MODERATE RISK with primarily documentation and transparency issues rather than active security threats. The skill's core functionality (fetching YouTube transcripts via residential IP proxy) is legitimate, but lacks proper metadata declarations. Key concerns: (1) Missing allowed-tools declaration for Python/Bash usage, (2) Network communication not explicitly disclosed in description, (3) Short subprocess timeouts may cause availability issues, (4) Missing license/compatibility metadata. No evidence of data exfiltration, prompt injection, credential theft, or malicious code execution. The VPN configuration requirement is clearly documented and serves a legitimate technical purpose (bypassing YouTube's cloud IP blocks). The skill operates transparently within its stated scope.",
