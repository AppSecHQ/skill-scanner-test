      "description": "The installation instructions direct users to download and execute a bash script from GitHub without any integrity verification (no checksum, signature, or hash validation). The script is immediately made executable and placed in a system directory (/usr/local/bin/). An attacker who compromises the GitHub repository or performs a man-in-the-middle attack could inject malicious code that would be executed with the user's privileges. This represents arbitrary code execution with no security controls.",

API keys are sensitive credentials that provide access to paid services and should be protected.
