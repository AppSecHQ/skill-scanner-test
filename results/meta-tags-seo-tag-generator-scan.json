      "description": "The skill instructs installation of an npm package '@lxgicstudios/meta-tags' from a third-party source without any verification, version pinning, or security validation. This creates supply chain risk as the package could be compromised, contain malicious code, or be subject to typosquatting attacks. The skill provides no provenance information, security audit details, or package integrity verification.",

      "remediation": "1. Specify exact package version (e.g., @lxgicstudios/meta-tags@1.2.3) instead of unpinned installation. 2. Provide package verification instructions (npm audit, checksum validation). 3. Include provenance information (npm registry stats, GitHub stars, maintainer info). 4. Warn users to review package contents before installation. 5. Consider providing alternative verification methods or suggesting users inspect the package source code first.",

        "overall_assessment": "This skill is a wrapper for an external npm package that generates SEO meta tags. The primary security concern is the unverified third-party package installation without version pinning or security validation, creating supply chain risk. The skill itself contains no malicious code, prompt injection attempts, or data exfiltration patterns. However, it lacks important metadata (license, compatibility, allowed-tools) and provides no guidance on error handling or resource limits. The skill appears legitimate in purpose (SEO meta tag generation) but requires users to trust an external package without verification mechanisms. Overall risk is MODERATE due to supply chain concerns, but there are no indicators of intentionally malicious behavior.",
