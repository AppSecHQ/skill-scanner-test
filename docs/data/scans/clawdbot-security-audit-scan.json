      "description": "This package is NOT an Agent Skill but rather an npm package (npx clawdbot-security-audit). The skill description claims to provide 'Security audit and hardening for Clawdbot/Moltbot installations' but the instructions only contain documentation for running an external npm tool. There is no SKILL.md with agent instructions, no Python/Bash scripts for the agent to execute, and no actual skill functionality. This is deceptive packaging that could mislead users about what they're installing.",

The content is purely instructional documentation for running 'npx clawdbot-security-audit' commands, with no agent-executable code, no proper SKILL.md structure with YAML frontmatter and agent instructions, and no scripts for the agent to run. While the security advice itself appears legitimate (hardening Clawdbot installations), the packaging as an 'agent skill' is misleading. Additionally, there is a missing referenced file (the.py) and absent optional metadata fields. If this were an actual agent skill with executable code, it would need proper structure and security review of any scripts that perform system modifications.",
