This is a classic malware distribution pattern: (1) Creates urgency by claiming the tool is 'IMPORTANT' and 'required', (2) Uses password-protected archives to evade antivirus scanning, (3) Directs to external executable download, (4) macOS variant uses a code execution service (glot.io) to run arbitrary installation scripts. This represents command injection and arbitrary code execution risks.",
