        "overall_assessment": "This skill is a documentation/tutorial package for the Azure Container Registry Python SDK with LOW to MEDIUM security risk. The primary concern is the unpinned package dependency which could introduce supply chain vulnerabilities. The skill contains no executable scripts, no data exfiltration attempts, no prompt injection, and no malicious code. It's essentially a reference guide showing legitimate Azure SDK usage patterns. The missing optional metadata fields reduce transparency but don't constitute a security threat. The skill appropriately uses Azure's recommended authentication patterns (DefaultAzureCredential). The referenced Python files (ArtifactTagOrder.py, etc.) are standard Azure SDK imports, not bundled files, so their absence is expected and not a security concern.",
