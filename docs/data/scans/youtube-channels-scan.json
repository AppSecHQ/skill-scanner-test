      "description": "The SKILL.md instructions guide users to store their TRANSCRIPT_API_KEY in ~/.zshenv using echo append, which could lead to accidental exposure or misconfiguration. While the skill itself doesn't contain hardcoded secrets, the setup pattern encourages storing sensitive credentials in shell configuration files that may be inadvertently committed to version control or exposed through other means. The instructions also demonstrate the API key in curl commands, which could lead to shell history exposure.",

      "remediation": "Recommend using more secure credential storage methods such as: (1) dedicated credential managers (e.g., pass, 1Password CLI), (2) encrypted environment variable stores, (3) warning users about shell history exposure when using API keys in curl commands, (4) suggesting .env files with proper .gitignore configuration instead of shell config files.",

        "overall_assessment": "The youtube-channels skill is a relatively safe wrapper around the TranscriptAPI.com service with no critical security vulnerabilities. The skill contains no executable scripts, no data exfiltration code, no prompt injection attempts, and no malicious behavior. The primary concerns are around credential management practices in the setup instructions (MEDIUM severity) and missing optional metadata transparency (LOW severity). The skill accurately describes its functionality and doesn't attempt to deceive users about its purpose. The external API dependency and credit-based pricing model should be more prominently disclosed, but this represents a transparency issue rather than a security threat. No executable code means no command injection, eval/exec risks, or tool exploitation vectors. Overall, this skill demonstrates good security hygiene with room for improvement in credential handling guidance and metadata completeness.",
