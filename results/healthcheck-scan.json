      "description": "The skill implements an 'auto-log' feature that automatically records water intake entries (with 0 cups) if the user does not respond within 15 minutes of a reminder. This creates an unbounded autonomous behavior where the system makes decisions and modifies user data without explicit consent. The auto-log entries are marked as automatic but still pollute the user's health tracking data, potentially affecting statistics and habit calculations. This represents a form of availability disruption through unwanted automated actions.",

While this field is optional, the skill's behavior suggests it needs Write access (to modify health-data.json) and potentially Bash/Python (for node-cron scheduling).
