The skill provides documentation and a connection testing script without any malicious behavior. The primary issues are minor documentation inconsistencies: a missing referenced file (different.py), and missing optional metadata fields. The test script (test_kimi_connection.sh) performs legitimate API connectivity tests using environment variables for credentials, which is the correct security practice. No prompt injection, data exfiltration, command injection, or other security threats were detected. The skill is SAFE for use, with only minor documentation improvements recommended.",
