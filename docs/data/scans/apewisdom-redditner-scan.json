      "title": "Unvalidated External API Data Exfiltration Risk",
      "description": "The skill makes network requests to an external third-party API (apewisdom.io) without any validation of the response data or error handling for malicious payloads. While the API appears legitimate, the skill blindly trusts and processes external data that could contain malicious content or be compromised. The response data is directly parsed and displayed without sanitization, creating a potential vector for indirect prompt injection or data manipulation.",

      "snippet": "response = requests.get(url)\nresponse.raise_for_status()\ndata = response.json()\nreturn data.get(\"results\", [])[:limit]",
      "remediation": "1. Implement response validation to verify data structure and types before processing. 2. Add content sanitization for all string fields from the API. 3. Implement rate limiting and request timeouts. 4. Consider caching responses to reduce external dependencies. 5. Add integrity checks or use HTTPS certificate pinning for the API endpoint.",

        "overall_assessment": "The apewisdom skill is a relatively straightforward Reddit sentiment scanner that fetches data from a third-party API. The primary security concern is the unvalidated trust placed in external API responses, which could be exploited if the API is compromised or returns malicious data. The skill does not attempt prompt injection, credential theft, or data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. However, it lacks important security metadata and proper error handling for network operations. The skill's behavior matches its stated purpose, and there are no hidden capabilities or deceptive elements. Overall risk level is MODERATE due to external API dependency without validation.",
