      "description": "The skill requires MACHFIVE_API_KEY environment variable but provides no guidance on secure storage, rotation, or scope limitations. Users may hardcode keys in shell profiles or insecure locations. The skill also accepts API keys via X-API-Key header, increasing exposure surface.",

      "snippet": "Setup instructions: 'Set `MACHFIVE_API_KEY` in your environment' and 'Or use `X-API-Key: {MACHFIVE_API_KEY}` header' without security warnings or best practices.",
      "remediation": "Add security guidance: (1) Use secure credential managers (e.g., 1Password, AWS Secrets Manager), (2) Never commit keys to version control, (3) Rotate keys regularly, (4) Use minimum-scope API keys, (5) Warn about X-API-Key header exposure in logs/network traffic.",

The skill transmits potentially sensitive lead data (PII, business intelligence) to a third-party service without explicit privacy disclosures or consent warnings. API key security guidance is insufficient, risking credential exposure. The skill lacks critical metadata (license, compatibility, allowed-tools) reducing transparency. Long-running sync requests (3-5 min) may cause agent timeouts and resource issues without proper async handling. Referenced files (lead.py, the.py) are missing from the package. No evidence of prompt injection, command injection, or malicious code execution was found. The skill appears functionally legitimate but requires improved security documentation and data handling transparency.",
