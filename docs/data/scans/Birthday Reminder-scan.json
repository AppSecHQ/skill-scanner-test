      "title": "Hardcoded Absolute Path Outside Skill Package",
      "description": "The skill uses hardcoded absolute paths (/home/clawd/clawd/data/birthdays.md and /home/clawd/clawd/data/birthdays.json) that reference locations outside the skill's package directory. This creates a data exposure risk as the skill accesses a fixed system location rather than using relative paths within its own directory. If multiple users or systems use this skill, it could lead to unauthorized data access or conflicts. The path appears to be user-specific and may expose or modify data belonging to a specific user account.",

        "overall_assessment": "The birthday-reminder skill is a relatively straightforward birthday management tool with MODERATE security concerns. The primary issue is the use of hardcoded absolute paths pointing to a specific user's home directory (/home/clawd/clawd/data/), which creates data exposure risks and portability problems. The skill performs basic file read/write operations to manage birthday data in JSON format, with no evidence of network calls, credential theft, command injection, or prompt injection attempts. The code is transparent and matches its stated purpose. However, the hardcoded paths and missing metadata reduce the skill's security posture. The skill would benefit from using relative paths within its own package directory and adding optional metadata fields for better transparency.",
