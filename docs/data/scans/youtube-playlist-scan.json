      "description": "The skill requires users to store a TRANSCRIPT_API_KEY in their shell environment (~/.zshenv) but provides no validation, sanitization, or secure storage guidance. Users are instructed to echo sensitive credentials directly into shell configuration files, which may be committed to version control or exposed through insecure backups. The skill also transmits this key in Authorization headers to a third-party service (transcriptapi.com) without any verification of the service's legitimacy or security posture.",
