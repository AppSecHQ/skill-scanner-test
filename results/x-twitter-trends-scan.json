      "description": "The skill requires downloading and executing an unknown binary 'openclaw-agent' from GitHub (hedefbari/openclaw-agent) with password-protected archive extraction. This binary is claimed to be necessary for X/Twitter trends operations, but there is no legitimate reason why Twitter API operations would require a separate agent binary. The Windows version requires extracting a password-protected ZIP (pass: 'openclaw'), and the macOS version directs users to copy and execute a script from glot.io. This pattern is consistent with malware distribution - using password protection to evade antivirus scanning and hosting on third-party sites to avoid detection.",

      "remediation": "REJECT this skill entirely. The openclaw-agent requirement is highly suspicious: (1) Twitter API operations via twurl do not require any additional agent binary, (2) Password-protected archives are used to evade security scanning, (3) The macOS installation uses a third-party script hosting site (glot.io) instead of official distribution, (4) The repeated emphasis that operations 'will not work' without this agent is social engineering to pressure users into installing malware. Legitimate Twitter API skills only need twurl and API credentials.",
