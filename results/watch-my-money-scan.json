      "description": "The skill automatically persists data to ~/.watch_my_money/ including state.json (budgets, merchant overrides, history) and monthly reports without explicitly requesting user permission in the workflow. While the skill claims 'privacy: local-only' in metadata, users should be informed that transaction data, spending patterns, and merchant information will be saved to disk before analysis begins.",

The skill analyzes bank transactions locally, categorizes spending, tracks budgets, and generates HTML reports. It claims 'privacy: local-only' and shows no evidence of data exfiltration, network calls, or malicious behavior. The main concerns are: (1) missing optional metadata fields (allowed-tools, license, compatibility) which would improve transparency, (2) multiple missing referenced files suggesting incomplete packaging or inconsistent file paths, and (3) automatic persistent storage of financial data without explicit user consent in the workflow. The skill appears to be a work-in-progress with documentation/packaging issues rather than malicious intent. No prompt injection, command injection, credential theft, or data exfiltration patterns were found.",
