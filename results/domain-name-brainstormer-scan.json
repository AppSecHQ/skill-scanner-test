      "description": "The skill description and instructions claim to 'check availability across multiple TLDs' and 'verifies which domains are actually available', but no implementation exists. The skill contains no Python/Bash scripts to perform actual domain availability checks via WHOIS, DNS queries, or domain registrar APIs. The example output shows 'Available' status markers (\u2713) implying real availability verification, but this is deceptive - the agent would only be generating fictional availability data without actual verification capability.",

      "remediation": "Either: (1) Remove all claims about checking actual domain availability and rebrand as a 'domain name idea generator' only, or (2) Implement actual domain availability checking via Python script using libraries like python-whois, dnspython, or domain registrar APIs with proper error handling and rate limiting.",

        "overall_assessment": "This skill is a domain name brainstorming tool with MODERATE security concerns primarily related to misleading capability claims rather than active security threats. The skill claims to check domain availability across multiple TLDs but provides no implementation to actually perform this verification - no scripts, no API calls, no WHOIS lookups. This constitutes social engineering through deceptive descriptions (AITech-2.1). The skill would generate fictional availability data, potentially misleading users. However, there are NO active security threats like data exfiltration, prompt injection, command injection, or credential theft. The skill is essentially a text generation template without executable code. The missing optional metadata fields (license, compatibility, allowed-tools) reduce transparency but are low severity. Primary recommendation: Either implement actual domain checking functionality or rebrand as an 'idea generator' without availability claims.",
